        <h2>The Shark Family</h2>
        <p class="para1">I've always been a shark, and not just because of my last name or my love for the mighty salmon. I first discovered my passion for baking at a young age, growing up at sea on my fathers fishing boat as we sailed the world looking for exotic an catch. Spending most of my childhood in the galley kitchen, preparing meals for the crew and my father, I had to often make due with what Poseidon would grant us as we harvested the depths of his watery domain. When a few of the crew members requested fresh baked cookies after venturing through a mighty storm one evening, I quickly had to adapt with limited resources. The results of that has been histroy.</p>
